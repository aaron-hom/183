            Polar bears finding it harder to catch enough seals to meet energy demands

          <div class="under_title">
                Study reveals high metabolic rates, meaning polar bears need a lot of
                fat-rich prey, but more than half of those studied were running an energy
                deficit.

             <p>A new study finds polar bears in the wild have higher metabolic rates than
                previously thought, and as climate change alters their environment a growing
                number of beam are unable to catch enough prey to meet their energy needs.</p>

             <p>The study, published February 2 in Science, reveals the physiological mechanisms
                behind observed declines in polar bear populations, said first author Anthony Pagano,
                a Ph.D. candidate at UC Santa Cruz. "We've been documenting declines in polar bear
                survival rates, body condition, and population numbers over the past decade," he said.
                This study identifies the mechanisms that are driving those declines by looking at the
                actual energy needs of polar bears and how often they're able to catch seals."</p>

             <p>Pagano, who is also a wildlife biologist with the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS),
                conducted the study as part of his Ph.D. thesis research at UC Santa Cruz, where he has
                been working with coauthors Terrie Williams and Daniel Costa, both professors of ecology
                and evolutionary biology.</p>

              <div class="half">
              <p>The researchers monitored the behavior, hunting success, and metabolic rates of adult
                 female polar bears without cubs as they hunted for prey on the sea ice of the Beaufort
                 Sea in the spring. High-tech collars on the bears recorded video, locations, and activity
                 levels over a period of eight to 11 days, while metabolic tracers enabled the team to
                 determine how much energy the bears expended.</p><br/>

              <p>The field metabolic rates they measured averaged more than 50 percent higher than
                 previous studies had predicted Five of the nine bears in the study lost body mass,
                 meaning they weren't catching enough fat-rich marine mammal prey to meet their energy
                 demands.</p><br/>

              <p>This was at the start of the period from April through July when polar bears catch most
                 of their prey and put on most of the body fat they need to sustain them throughout the
                 year," Pagano said.</p>
